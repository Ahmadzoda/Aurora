For me, the explanation of working with stops and money management was the most important. It was at these moments that I often lost what I earned. Not to mention the stress that I used to It was also very interesting to get acquainted with the concepts of the main movement of the day and ATR, which I had not heard about before, although I read a lot of literature, including books by Appel and Edler.Thank you for the unique opportunity to get acquainted with the approaches to trading in the markets of such a high-level professional as Igor Toshchakov",
